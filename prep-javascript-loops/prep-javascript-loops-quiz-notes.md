## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is the purpose of the **condition** expression in the `for` and `while` loops?
  'for' (initialization; condition; increment) {}(the condition expression is typically used to iterate over a sequence of elements or perform a specific number of iterations.)
  'while' (condition) {}(the condition expression is explicitly defined by the programmer)
- When is the first expression in the parentheses for a `for` loop (known as the **initialization**) evaluated?
  for (initialization; condition; increment) {} let i = 0 (evaluated before the loop begins executing)
- When is the second expression in the parentheses for a `for` loop (known as the **condition**) evaluated?
  for (initialization; condition; increment) {} i < 5 (evaluated before each iteration of the loop.)
- When is the third expression in the parentheses for a `for` loop (known as the **final expression**) evaluated?
  for (initialization; condition; final expression) {} i++(evaluated at the end of each iteration)
- What is the purpose of the **final expression** in a `for` loop?
  it increments and is used to modify the loop variable or perform additional operations at the end of each iteration.
- What types of data should the `for...in` loop be used on?
  is commonly used to iterate over the enumerable properties of a plain JavaScript object.
